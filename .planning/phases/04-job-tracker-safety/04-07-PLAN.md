  <name>Task 1: Read tracker UI component files</name>
  <files>
    src/entrypoints/popup/components/TrackerList.tsx

    src/lib/store/tracker-store.test.ts
  </files>
  <action>
Read all tracker UI component files to understand:

1. **TrackerList.tsx** - Main list component with filters integration, empty states, loading states
2. **TrackerFilters.tsx** - Multi-criteria filtering (status, platform, date range) and sorting controls
3. **ApplicationCard.tsx** - Individual application card with status updates and delete functionality
4. **tracker-store.ts** - Zustand store managing tracker state (applications, filters, sorting)
5. **tracker-store.test.ts** - Test coverage for store operations

Extract:
- Component structure and props
- State management patterns
- UI/UX design decisions
- Filtering and sorting logic
- Empty states and loading states
- Test coverage details

Use grep to find any additional tracker-related files:
```bash
git log --all --oneline --grep="04-04" | head -10
ls src/entrypoints/popup/components/ | grep -i tracker
ls src/lib/store/ | grep -i tracker
```

This will help identify what was actually built for Plan 04-04.

  <name>Task 2: Extract git history for Plan 04-04</name>
  <files>N/A (git history query)</files>
  <action>
Extract git commits related to Plan 04-04 to understand what was built:

```bash
# Find commits with 04-04 in message
git log --all --oneline --grep="04-04" --date=iso

# Find commits that modified tracker UI components (likely Plan 04-04)
git log --all --oneline --date=iso -- \
  src/entrypoints/popup/components/TrackerList.tsx \
  src/entrypoints/popup/components/TrackerFilters.tsx \
  src/entrypoints/popup/components/ApplicationCard.tsx \
  src/lib/store/tracker-store.ts

# Get detailed commit info
git show --stat <commit-hashes-found>
```

Extract:
- Commit hashes and messages
- Timestamps (for duration calculation)
- Files created/modified
- Line counts

This provides the "Task Commits" section and performance metrics.

  <name>Task 3: Write 04-04-SUMMARY.md following template</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/04-job-tracker-safety/04-04-SUMMARY.md</files>
  <action>
Write comprehensive SUMMARY.md following the established template pattern from 04-01, 04-02, 04-03, 04-05.

**Required sections:**

1. **Frontmatter** (YAML):
```yaml
---
phase: 04-job-tracker-safety
plan: 04
subsystem: tracker
tags: [react, zustand, tracker-ui, filtering, sorting]

# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 04-01
    provides: Tracker data layer (storage, types, utils)
provides:
  - TrackerList component with filtering and sorting
  - ApplicationCard component with status updates
  - TrackerFilters component with multi-criteria filtering
  - Zustand store for tracker state management
affects: [04-05]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - [List React patterns used]
    - [List Zustand patterns]
    - [List UI/UX patterns]

key-files:
  created: [list files]
  modified: [list files]

key-decisions: [list decisions]
patterns-established: [list patterns]

# Metrics
duration: [duration in minutes]
completed: [date from git]
---
```

2. **Summary title and subtitle** - Brief description of what was built

3. **Performance** - Duration, timestamps, tasks, files

4. **Accomplishments** - Bullet list of what was delivered

5. **Task Commits** - Each task with commit hash and description

6. **Files Created/Modified** - Categorized list with line counts and descriptions

7. **Decisions Made** - Design decisions, UX choices, technical choices with rationale and impact

8. **Deviations from Plan** - Note if plan was followed exactly or list deviations

9. **Issues Encountered** - Any problems and how they were resolved

10. **User Setup Required** - None expected for UI components

11. **Next Phase Readiness** - Confirms 04-05 can proceed

12. **Self-Check** - Verify all files exist

**Content guidance:**

- **Accomplishments**: Focus on filtering (status, platform), sorting (date/company/status), empty states, loading states, ApplicationCard features (status dropdown, delete, notes)

- **Decisions Made**: Document why certain UI patterns were chosen:
  - Why grid layout for filters?
  - Why card-based design for applications?
  - Why inline status dropdown vs modal?
  - Why sort order toggle vs separate buttons?

- **Design patterns**: Document React/Zustand patterns:
  - Zustand store managing filter/sort state
  - useEffect for loading on mount
  - Computed filtered applications
  - Component composition (TrackerList > TrackerFilters + ApplicationCard[])

- **UX choices**: Document user experience decisions:
  - Empty states (no data vs no results from filters)
  - Clear filters button placement
  - Application count display
  - Loading spinner design

**Write comprehensive but concise.** Follow the tone and structure of existing SUMMARYs. Include specific implementation details (not just "built tracker UI" but "TrackerList component with 112 lines integrating TrackerFilters and ApplicationCard with empty/loading states").
  </action>
  <verify>Read created 04-04-SUMMARY.md and verify it matches template structure and contains all required sections</verify>
  <done>04-04-SUMMARY.md exists with complete documentation of tracker UI implementation (≥100 lines)</done>

<verification>
Verify SUMMARY.md completeness:

1. **File exists:**
```bash
ls -lh .planning/phases/04-job-tracker-safety/04-04-SUMMARY.md
```

2. **Has all sections:**
```bash
grep -E "^(phase:|## Performance|## Accomplishments|## Task Commits|## Files Created|## Decisions Made|## Next Phase Readiness)" .planning/phases/04-job-tracker-safety/04-04-SUMMARY.md
```

3. **References tracker UI files:**
```bash
grep -E "(TrackerList|TrackerFilters|ApplicationCard|tracker-store)" .planning/phases/04-job-tracker-safety/04-04-SUMMARY.md | wc -l
```
Should have multiple references (≥10).

4. **Frontmatter is valid YAML:**
```bash
head -50 .planning/phases/04-job-tracker-safety/04-04-SUMMARY.md | grep -A 50 "^---$"
```
